# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

# Define the Problem
Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
Outcome Variable: Survived (0 for not survived, 1 for survived).

# Obtain the Dataset
Source: Download from Kaggle Titanic Competition.

# Explore the Data
Inspect: Review the structure of the dataset, including columns and data types.
Summary Statistics: Calculate basic statistics for numerical features and analyze distributions.

# Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values (e.g., for Age, Embarked).
Feature Engineering: Create new features (e.g., extracting titles from names) and encode categorical variables (e.g., converting Sex and Embarked to numerical values).
Normalization/Scaling: Normalize or scale numerical features if needed.

# Feature Selection
Identify Relevant Features: Select features such as Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked.
Create Additional Features: If applicable, create features like family size or age groups.

# Data Splitting
Training and Testing Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

# Model Selection
Choose Algorithms: Consider models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines.
Implement Models: Train and tune models using the training dataset.

# Model Training
Fit the Model: Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust parameters to optimize model performance.

# Model Evaluation
Evaluate Performance:Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Confusion Matrix: Analyze to understand the types of errors made by the model.

# Prediction
Test Set Predictions:
Use the trained model to predict survival on the test set.

# Interpret Results
Feature Importance:Determine which features have the most influence on survival predictions.
Model Performance: Review overall performance and effectiveness of the model.

# Communicate Findings
Visualizations:Create graphs and charts to illustrate key findings and model performance.
Report: Summarize methodology, results, and insights in a detailed report.

# Refine the Model
Iterate:Based on evaluation results, refine features, adjust parameters, or try alternative models to improve accuracy and performance.
